# My First Flutter Project

Welcome to my first project created with Flutter! ðŸš€

## Project Overview
This project is a beginner's exploration into Flutter development. It focuses on the basics of setting up a Flutter app and displaying an image on the screen. This foundational project helped me get familiar with Flutter's structure, widgets, and basic layout.

## Features
- **Single Image Display**: The app contains a simple interface that displays a photo as the main focus. It's designed to experiment with image handling in Flutter.

## Why This Project?
Starting with a basic app allows me to understand the fundamentals of Flutter before diving into more complex features. This project marks the beginning of my Flutter journey, and I'm excited to continue learning and building more!

## Next Steps
From here, I plan to expand my Flutter skills and add more features to future projects. Stay tuned!
